# Textures



* They are a power of two (For example, 512 x 512 or 256 x 1024).
* Use Texture Atlases wherever possible.
* It is better to resize the texture in Photoshop then to use Unityâ€™s compression options when the in game texture resolution is already known. This reduces the file size and import time of the texture into Unity.
* When working with a high-resolution source PSD outside your Unity project use the same name for both the high-resolution and the imported Unity file. This allows quick iteration when swapping between the 2 textures.

More information for importing textures can be found here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingTextures.html
