# Audio

Audio must be recorded in WAV or OGG formats, in a noise-less environment. Recordings should be one file per voice line or sound effect. They must be cut down to include no more than 1 second of deadspace before the audio, and preferrably less than 1 second, with a hard limit of 3 seconds, of deadspace after the audio. Source audio should not be edited. If possible, sample rate should be above 32KHz and channel depth should be at least 24-bits. In the case of music files, they must loop seamlessly.

Audio editing will be done in the Cakewalk DAW. There filters and other editing will be applied to source files. Composing will be done there through Midi sequencing and VST plugins. All edited audio should be exported in WAV format, with a sampling rate of at least 32KHz and a 24-bit channel depth.

In Unity the source files should be imported in dedicated folders divided by sound cue. Each sound cue will reside in that folder alongside its edited source files.
