# Important Terminology

## Scenes/Levels
The word 'scene' generally refers to what the average person calls a 'level' and may be used interchangeably. See this term's history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games))

We prefer the word Scenes over Levels

## variables / Properties

The words 'variable' and 'property' in most contexts are interchangable. If they are both used together in the same context however:

## Property
Usually refers to a variable defined in a class. For example, if BP_Barrel had a variable bExploded, bExploded may be referred to as a property of BP_Barrel.
When in the context of a class, it is often used to imply accessing previously defined data.

## Variable
Usually refers to a variable defined as a function argument or a local variable inside a function.
When in the context of a class, it is often used to convey discussion about its definition and what it will hold.
