## Compiling
All scripts should compile with the least amount of warnings possible and zero errors. You should fix script warnings and errors immediately as they can quickly cascade into very scary unexpected behavior.

Do not submit broken scripts to source control. If you must store them on source control, shelve/stash them instead.
